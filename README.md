# Robot Parts

**Drive wheel:** This part drives the track, and the robot hence the name "drive wheel". The clearances are adjusted so that it fits nicely on the motor shaft, but it features a screw hole in case it doesn't.

**Idler:** This is the non-driving wheel for the tracks, but it also doubles as a tensioner. Thanks to its eccentric shaft, it can be used to adjust the slack on the chain.

**Idler retainer:** Idler retainer retains the idler :)

**Body:** This is the chassis of the robot. It houses all the parts. There are two versions of body. One is accessorizable and the other one is plain (located in Misc folder). As the name implies, accessorizable body is designed to fit accessories utilizing standard accessory connector.

**Top cover:** This part basically prevents things from falling off. It keeps the batteries in place, it prevents circuit board to fall off, and it even acts as the idler retainer retainer. All these functions in one single part. It attaches to the body by one rigid attachment point in the back, and one flexible attachment point in the front. This part also has two versions, accessorizable and plain (located in Misc folder).

**Track:** This is the part that moves the robot. It is basically a chain with 20 links.
